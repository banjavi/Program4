CSC 460 | Program #4: Database-driven Web Application
Authors: Alex, Bijan, Colin, Monica,

A ReadMe.txt describing how the TA can operate your website to see the required functionalities,
and the work-load distribution among team members (that is, who was responsible for what?).


How To Operate
-----------------
To test the required functionalities (insertion, deletion, update), go to
the User Settings page while logged in as a Manager. Adding users (make sure the
category is typed in as either "Manager", "Employee", or "Customer" exactly), updating users,
and deleting users are all implemented. There are many other insertions, deletions, and updates
in the application, but this is the simplest way to see that the base requirements have been met
for the graders.


To test the 5 additional queries required, look at the "Query description"
section in the "Program4_DatabaseDesign.pdf" file in the doc folder. The pages/views
that implement those queries are shown in each query description. Go to those pages
in the application using a user that has the appropriate type in order to see confirmation that
they work.


Work-Load Distribution
-----------------
Alex: JSP pages (Employee, Customer), DatabaseController.java, database design document
Bijan: JSP pages (Manager), DatabaseController.java, setup.sql, database design document
Colin: DatabaseController.java, setup.sql, database design document + queries
Monica: DatabaseController.java, database design document + queries + ER diagram, documentation


Very even work-load distribution amongst group members (approx. 25% for each
group member).
